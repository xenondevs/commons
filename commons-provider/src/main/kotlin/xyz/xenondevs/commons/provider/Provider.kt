/**
 * A [Provider] is a thread-safe, lazily-evaluated, reactive data source that holds a single value of type [T].
 *
 * Using [map], [flatMap], and various extension functions, atomic data transformations can be modelled.
 * 
 * Additionally, it is also possible to [subscribe] to and [observe] providers.
 * Note that subscribing disables the lazy evaluation of the provider, as the value will need to be calculated
 * immediately when an update happens in order to propagate it to the subscribers.
 * 
 * It is important that all data transformation functions are pure, meaning that they are side effect free and
 * do not access any mutable external state, in order to maintain the integrity of lazy evaluation. It is especially
 * important that they do not resolve any other provider's value, **as doing so may risk deadlocks**.
 * To properly operate on the values of multiple providers, combine them first via [combinedProvider].
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * ```kotlin
 * val provider0 = provider { "Hello" } // Provider with lazy value of "Hello"
 * val provider1 = provider0.map { it + ", World!" } // Lazily maps the value of provider by appending ", World!" to it
 * 
 * println(provider1.get()) // "Hello, World!" (runs lambdas above)
 * println(provider1.get()) // "Hello, World!" (cached value)
 * ```
 *
